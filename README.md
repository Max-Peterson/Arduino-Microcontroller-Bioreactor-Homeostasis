# Arduino-Microcontroller-Bioreactor-Homeostatis
The code that runs the homeostatic balance of the bioreactor environment by taking measurements of carbon dioxide concentration and temperature. When these values dip below the target, the pins that correspond to the compressed carbon dioxide release valve and the heating unit are activated accordingly.
